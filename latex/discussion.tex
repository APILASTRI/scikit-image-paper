  In this section, we describe other libraries with similar goals to ours.
  
  Within the scientific Python ecosystem, Mahotas contains many similar
  functions, and is furthermore also designed to work with NumPy arrays
  \citep{Mahotas}. The major philosophical difference between Mahotas and
  scikit-image is that Mahotas is almost exclusively written in templated C++,
  while scikit-image is written in Python and Cython. We feel that our choice
  lowers the barrier of entry to modifying the code and contributing, and that
  is borne out by the greater number of contibutors to our library. However,
  thanks to the interoperability between the two provided by the NumPy array
  data format, users don't have to choose between them, and can simply use the
  best components of each.

  The heavyweight force in open-source image analysis is ImageJ and its
  batteries-included Fiji distribution \citep{Fiji}. Our library is
  certainly not as feature complete as Fiji, and may never be, because Fiji's
  extensive library of plugins continues to grow at a dramatic pace. We feel,
  however, that we offer significant advantages over that software. First,
  ImageJ and Fiji are designed for interactive, GUI use. Although they offer a
  programmable macro mode supporting many scripting languages, many of the
  macro functions activate GUI elements and cannot run in headless mode. This
  is problematic for data analysis in high-performance computing cluster
  environments. Additionally, Fiji's extremely inclusive plugin policy results
  in a very inconsistent API and variable documentation quality. For example,
  some plugins take image file paths as input, while others work on the
  currently active image. Using scikit-image to develop new functionality or
  build batch applications for distributed computing is often much simpler,
  thanks to its consistent API and the wide distribution of the scientific
  Python stack.

  In many respects, the image analysis toolbox of the Matlab environment is
  quite similar to scikit-image. For example, its API is mostly functional and
  applies to generic multidimensional numeric arrays. However, Matlab's
  commercial licensing can be a significant nuisance to users. Additionally,
  the licensing cost increases dramatically for parallel computing, with
  per-worker pricing\footnote{\url{http://www.mathworks.com.au/products/distriben/description3.html}, Accessed 2014-05-09}.
  Finally, the closed source nature of the toolbox prevents users from
  modifying the code to specific purposes, which is a common necessity in
  scientific research.

  OpenCV is an open-source computer vision library with a separate image
  processing module, free for use under the BSD-license \citep{opencv}. It is
  developed in C/C++ and the project's aim is to provide implementations for
  real-time applications, which makes OpenCV a library with comparatively high
  barrier of entry for code study and modification. The library provides
  interfaces for several high-level programming languages, including Python
  through the NumPy-array data-type for images. The Python interface is
  essentially a one-to-one copy of the underlying C/C++ API, and thus image
  processing pipelines have to follow an imperative programming style. As
  opposed to scikit-image, which provides a Pythonic interface with the option
  to follow an imperative or functional approach. Beyond that, OpenCV's image
  processing module is traditionally limited to 2-dimensional imagery.

  The choice of image processing package depends on several factors, including
  speed, code quality and correctness, community support, ecosystem, feature
  richness, and users' ability to contribute. Sometimes, advantages in one
  factor come at the cost of another. For example, our approach of writing code
  in a high-level language may affect performance, or our strict code review
  guidelines may hamper the number of features we ultimately provide. We
  motivate our design decisions for scikit-image in the
  \ref{sec:development-practices} section, and leave readers to decide which
  library is right for them.
