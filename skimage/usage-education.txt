In addition to regular training sessions, scikit-image is ideal for education
through self-taught exploration. We have delivered
image processing tutorials using scikit-image at various
annual scientific Python conferences, e.g. EuroSciPy [euroscipy2013]_, PyData
2012 [pydata2012]_ and SciPy India
2012). Course materials for some of these sessions are found in
[scipylecturenotes]_ and are licensed under the permissive [cc-by]_
license.  These typically include an introduction to the package and provide
intuitive, hands-on introductions to image processing concepts. The well
documented application programming interface (API) along with tools that
facilitate visualization contribute to the learning experience, and make it
easy to investigate the effect of different algorithms and parameters.
For example, when investigating denoising, it is easy to observe the difference
between applying a median filter (``filter.rank.median``) and a
Gaussian filter (``filter.gaussian_filter``),
demonstrating that a median filter preserves straight lines much better.

Since scikit-image operates on standard NumPy arrays, it benefits and
integrates with other tools commonly used to teach Python, such as the IPython
notebook [ipython]_.

For self-taught exploration, the online gallery of examples not only provides
an overview of the functionality available in the package but also
introduces many of the algorithms commonly used in image processing.
This visual index also helps beginners overcome a common entry barrier:
locating the class (denoising, segmentation, etc.) and name of operation
desired, without being proficient with image processing jargon.  For many
functions, the documentation includes links to research papers or Wikipedia
pages to further guide the user.

Finally, easy access to readable source code is another way to learn about
the way algorithms are implemented, and gather further insight into some of the
intricacies of a fast Python implementation, such as indexing tricks
and look-up tables.
