scikit-image is well suited for industrial applications due to the 
breadth and maturity of its code base, and its use of the 
commercial-friendly BSD license. 

BT Imaging designs and builds tools that use photoluminescence (PL) 
imaging for photovoltaic applications [BTImaging]_. PL imaging can characterize 
the quality of multicrystalline silicon wafers by illuminating defects 
that are not visible under standard viewing conditions. Figure :ref:`PL1` shows an optical image of a 
silicon wafer, while Figure :ref:`PL2` shows the same wafer using PL imaging. 
Figure :ref:`PL3` contains the results of image analysis. The image 
processing steps are as follows: foreground segmentation, rotation 
correction, cropping, and feature extraction. scikit-image plays a 
key role in this workflow. For example, ``transform.hough_line`` 
finds the wafer edges, and ``morphology.skeletonize`` determines the 
location of grain boundaries.

   A PL image of the wafer from Figure :ref:`PL1`. Wafer defects, which have a negative impact 
   solar cell efficiency, are visible as dark regions. :label:`PL2`

   Image processing results. Defects in the crystal growth are colored blue, while red indicates 
   the presence of impurities. :label:`PL3`
   

scikit-image is also being used in a commercial setting for biometric security applications. 
AICBT Ltd uses multispectral imaging to detect when a person 
is attempting to conceal their identity using a mask [AICBT]_. 
scikit-image is used for file I/O and histogram equalization. 
Furthermore, ``transform.AffineTransform`` aligns a visible 
wavelength image of a scene with a thermal image
in order to determine the surface temperature of a subject's face.
