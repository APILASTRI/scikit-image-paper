In research, scikit-image can be used to extract information about morphologies
in large stacks of images. For instance, let's consider the drying of a droplet
containing nanoparticles (See Figure :ref:`cracks`). As the drying proceeds,
cracks propagate from the drop edge to its center. The aim is to understand
crack patterns by collecting statistical information about their positions,
their time and order of appearance. To ease the data processing, each
experiment, constituted of an image stack, is automatically treated without
human intervention. The contact line is detected by a circular Hough transform
(``transform.hough_circle``) providing the drop radius and its center.  Then, a
second circle with a radius of a fraction of the droplet size is drawn to
collect its pixels. Repeating the process of each image of the stack, collected
pixels can be assembled to make a space-time diagram. As a result, a complex
stack of images can be reduced to a single image summarizing the dynamic
process.

   Scikit-image is being used to track the propagation of crack (black lines)
   in a drying colloidal droplet. The sequence of pictures shows the temporal
   evolution of the system with in green, the drop contact line detected by the
   Hough transform and in white, the circle used to reslice the image stack.
   The result is plotted and illustrates the angular position of cracks and
   their time of appearance. :label:`cracks`
