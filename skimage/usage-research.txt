A major component of imaging research is dealing with various image datatypes,
color representations, and file types. scikit-image offers researchers robust,
standards-compliant tools for converting between image datatypes and file
input/output (I/O) operations ([DirectX]_, [OpenGL]_, [GraphicsGemsI]_). These
tools, exposed in ``skimage.util`` and ``skimage.io``, are a powerful asset to
researchers in this field. Investigators new to Python may focus directly on
their work, maximizing productivity, instead of worrying about these tasks. Of
course, these are only a small fraction of what scikit-image offers.

scikit-image includes many algorithms with broad application across imaging
research, from computer vision to medical image analysis, and the tools
available are continually increasing in number and capability. Researchers in
computer vision and machine learning will appreciate the feature extraction
toolset in ``skimage.feature``; those studying segmentation will find both
unsupervised and supervised algorithms in ``skimage.segmentation``, and for
image restoration and denoising we have ``skimage.restoration`` and
``skimage.filter.denoise_*``. These are just a few examples of common tasks
researchers face, and an exhaustive listing is beyond the scope of this
manuscript. We refer the reader to the current API documentation for a full
listing of current capabilities [APIdocs]_. The remainder of this section will
illustrate real-world examples of scikit-image uses in research.

scikit-image may be used to extract information about patterns in large stacks
of images. For instance, let us consider the drying of a droplet containing
nanoparticles (See Figure :ref:`cracks`). As the drying proceeds,
cracks propagate from the drop edge to its center. The aim is to understand
crack patterns by collecting statistical information about their positions,
their time and order of appearance. To ease the data processing, each
experiment, constituted of an image stack, is automatically treated without
human intervention. The contact line is detected by a circular Hough transform
(``transform.hough_circle``) providing the drop radius and its center. Then, a
second circle with a radius of a fraction of the droplet size is drawn to
collect its pixels. Repeating the process on each image in the stack, collected
pixels can be assembled to make a space-time diagram. As a result, a complex
stack of images can be reduced to a single image summarizing the dynamic
process.

   Scikit-image is being used to track the propagation of cracks (black lines)
   in a drying colloidal droplet. The sequence of pictures shows the temporal
   evolution of the system with, in green, the drop contact line detected by the
   Hough transform and, in white, the circle used to reslice the image stack.
   The result is plotted and illustrates the angular position of cracks and
   their time of appearance. :label:`cracks`
